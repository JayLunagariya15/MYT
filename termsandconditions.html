            no
            provision of this agreement shall exclude or limit liability to the extent that such exclusion or limitation
            is

            any provisions of this Agreement, or any infringement (or apprehension of infringement) of MYT’s or its

            of the courts of England and Wales and you agree that you will procure that any third party making a claim
